During the early time of the internship, he independently took responsibility for the development of intelligent video analysis system Sensevideo. Later, he started the research on model quantization which can speed up the inference and even the training of neural networks on edge devices. Now he is devoted to further promoting the accuracy of extremely low-bit models and the auto-deployment of quantized models.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/ruihao-gong/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/ruihao-gong/","section":"authors","summary":"Ruihao Gong is currently a senior researcher at SenseTime.
